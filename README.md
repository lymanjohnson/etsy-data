This assignment includes bonus features:
- It uses a currency exchange API at www.apilayer.net to retrieve the latest currency conversion rates.
- It then uses this information to convert non-USD items into USD before calculating the average price in problem 1.
- It can handle all major currencies.
- In the original data.js file there was only one non-USD item, which was in GBP. I modified the data.js file so that more items would have different currency codes in order to demonstrate this additional functionality.
- It displays a count of how many unique currencies there are, how many items there are for each currency, and what the current exchange rate is.
- There are also many conditional statements and for loops to make sure that no matter how many different currencies there are, or how many items for each currency there are, the data will print in a legible and grammatically correct fashion.
